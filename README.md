# Webmen Default Silverstripe 4 Installer
This project installs the latest stable SilverStripe 4 CMS release.

Included in this installer;

* SilverStripe 4
* Docker environment with MariaDB/PHP-FPM/Nginx/Mailhog
* PHP CSFixer
* PHPStan
* PHPUnit
* Some default silverstripe packages (like thewebmen/silverstripe-elemental-grid, thewebmen/silverstripe-menustructure. Check `composer.json` for an overview with all packages)
* Webpack
* Bulma

## Important notice
* This repository should NOT contain a `composer.lock` file.
  * But the `composer.lock` file SHOULD get included in the new project
  * This is the reason the `composer.lock` is not included in the `.gitignore`
* You should also check the `composer.json` file on a new project and update them where needed

## How to use

### Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/thewebmen/silverstripe-installer project-name/`
* `cd project-name`
* Change the host ports in `docker-compose.yml`, `.env` and in this readme to an unused number (1 to 65535)
* Create a `.npmrc` with FontAwesome PRO keys (key found in BitWarden)
* Run `docker-compose up`
* Change the project name and description in `package.json`
* Change the project name and description in `composer.json`
* Change the name of this readme file and remove the "How to use and Important notice" chapter
* Change the stable releases in `composer.json` to the installed minor releases

### Overriding .env and using xDebug
If you want to override the `.env` or use xDebug, you can use the `docker-compose.override.yaml.dist` in combination with a `.env.local`.

* `cp docker-compose.override.yaml.dist docker-compose.override.yaml`
* create a `.env.local` with the data you don't want to get exposed
* Change target to `php-fmp` instead of `php-fpm-dev` if you want to disable xDebug

### Menus

On the default installation, there are some pre-defined menus with the following slugs;
* main-nav
* footer-top-nav
* footer-bottom-nav

This navigation's needs to get added in the `Menu` section, found in the Admin.

## Deployment

* Change the `host` and `user` for acceptance and production in `deploy.php`
* `mv .gitlab-ci.yml.example .gitlab-ci.yml`
* Edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the configuration you need

## PHP cs
`make test`  
`make fix-cs`  
Could be useful to enable in phpstorm (settings -> search for 'php cli interpreter')

## JS / CSS
**Please make sure the version in your `.nvmrc` is in sync with the `NODE_VERSION` argument in the `Dockerfile`**

Set node version: `nvm use`  
Build: `npm run build`  
Watch: `npm run watch`  

### Fontawesome

At Webmen we use Fontawesome PRO. You can find the `.npmrc` key in BitWarden.

If you don't have Fontawesome PRO, remove FontAwesome PRO from `package.json`

## ESlint
Could be useful to enable in phpstorm (settings -> search for 'eslint' -> automatic eslint configuration)

## Dev build
It is easier to do a dev build via the cli to avoid user rights issues  
`make devbuild`  

And there is also a `Make` command to run a dev/build with flush argument
`make devbuildflush`
